# Graph Search Algorithms in Java

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates various graph search algorithms using Java, including both tree search and graph search techniques. Implemented algorithms include Depth First Search (DFS), Breadth First Search (BFS), Uniform Cost Search, Greedy Search, and A* Search. The graph structure is represented using Java `HashSet` and `HashMap` to provide efficient ways to traverse nodes and evaluate paths.

## Project Structure

- **Graph.java**: Represents the graph structure using `HashMap` and `HashSet`.
- **TreeSearch.java**: Implements tree search algorithms:
    - Depth First Search (DFS)
    - Breadth First Search (BFS)
    - Uniform Cost Search
    - Greedy Search
    - A* Search
- **GraphSearch.java**: Implements graph search algorithms with cycle-checking:
    - Depth First Search (DFS)
    - Breadth First Search (BFS)
    - Uniform Cost Search
    - Greedy Search
    - A* Search
- **Runner Classes**: Each search type has its own runner class (e.g., `GreedyGraphRunner.java`) to test the algorithms.
- **README.md**: Documentation file (this file).

## Requirements

- Java JDK 8 or higher

## Setup and Installation
